# trebuchet
- Generate images and locations
    - openGL and cpp
    - the simulated goal is a floating hexagon
    - randomized texture training set
    - randomized texture validation set 
    - randomized texture test set
    - second test set of real images
    - third test set with real field images? if obtainable 
- train location estimator
- create a classical solution that relies on the location estimator
- create a ML solution that relies on the location estimator
- create an end-to-end ML solution
